                   <h2>Bored??</h2>
                   <h3>Play PACKMOJI that me and my partner made as part of our final project for this course.</h3>
                   <p>In this game you have to choose a cute character and make sure that it gets 30 points before timer runs out. 
                      Grab gems to score one ppoint and grab the duo of Amelia and Yusra to score 2 points. You cannot go across the walls.
                     For more help refer to the instructions tab.</p>
                   <p>It took us a month to make this project. It consists of almost 800 lines of code usig almost all of the constructs of Javascript 
                     that we learned in this class. Also the cute bitmojis that you see as a part of game is also made by us through coding. So enjoy the game and provide your valued feedback!! </p>
