                   <p>I am Yusra Suhail, a freshman at URI. I am from Pakistan and came to United States to study. I came here with an aim to 
                   excel in the field of Computer Science, and with every passing day my interest in this particular field keeps on growing.
                   I may not know exactly that what I will do with what I am studying, but I am very passionate about exploring this field 
                   and doing something exemplary.</p>

                   <p> Apart from studies, one of my extra curricular activites include public speaking. If I hear someone saying public speaking, 
                    I will be the first one to volunteer. This also includes debating, that something I just love beyond words. 
                    I have been a part of student council as well many times during my high school. In fact I also served as it's president. </p>
                  <img id= "debate" src= debatenew.jpg> 
                   <p> I love travelling with family and friends. I haven't been out of my country anywhere else than United States but inside Pakistan 
                     I have travelled a lot of places, exploring the scenic beauty and witnessing the beautiful landscape. </p>
